# File Description
1.Face Recognition (Jupyter file)
2. README File
3. image File

# Explaination
 Using Face Recognition Algorithm detect the face and create a bounding box around the face.
 And comapre both the images.
 If both the images are same then it will print True otherwise it will print False and also print the distance between the to faces on the test image.
